# Homework 6 Async Conditioner

## Overview
In this homework, I Created a debouncer and a one-pulse generator, then instantiated those along with the synchronizer from hw3 to get the functionallity of a full async conditioner for signal conditioning in general. This will be useful in future projects so that I can get a clean input responce for user input
